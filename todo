I want you to help me build a full-stack web application called "GovJobTrack" using Vue 2 for frontend and Spring Boot with MySQL for backend. The app is a government job alert platform where admins can post job notifications and users can browse, bookmark, and get notified of jobs.

I will manually collect and post job data via the admin panel â€” no scraping needed for now.

Frontend Requirements (Vue 2):

Home page that lists jobs in card/grid view

Job Detail page with full job info (title, dept, qualification, link, last date)

Admin login page and panel to post/edit/delete jobs

User login/register using JWT

User dashboard to bookmark jobs

Route management using Vue Router

State management using Vuex

Backend Requirements (Spring Boot):

REST APIs for:

User auth with JWT (login, register, role: USER/ADMIN)

Job CRUD (admin only)

Bookmarking jobs for logged-in users

Entities: User, Job, Bookmark

Use Spring Security + JWT

Use MySQL or PostgreSQL

Extra Notes:

Future scope: Add email alerts and Razorpay for premium features

Design should be clean, mobile-friendly, and ad-friendly (for AdSense approval later)

Generate the code in parts, starting with backend entities and controllers, then frontend components. Also provide setup instructions where needed.
